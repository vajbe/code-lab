## Key Areas

- **algo/array-strings/**: Array and string algorithm problems (duplicates, majority element, merging, rotation, etc.)
- **basics/basics/**: Basic Go concurrency (goroutines, channels)
- **design-patterns/**: Go implementations of design patterns (Singleton, Prototype, Generator)
- **multi-threading/**: Multithreading patterns and problems (thread pools, deadlocks, order processing, etc.)

## Getting Started

1. **Clone the repository:**
    ```sh
    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/go-multithreading.git
    cd go-multithreading
    ```

2. **Run Examples:**
    - Navigate to the desired directory (e.g., `algo/array-strings/` or `basics/basics/`)
    - Run a sample:
        ```sh
        cd algo/array-strings
        go run main.go
        ```

3. **Modify `main.go`** to call the function you want to test (uncomment as needed).

## Requirements

- Go 1.18 or higher (see [algo/go.mod](algo/go.mod))

## Highlights

- Wait Groups
- Concurrent Order Processing
- Sync Mutex Locks
- Channel usage
- Deadlock scenarios and solutions
- Thread-safe data structures
