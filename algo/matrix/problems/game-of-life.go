ðŸ§© Problem: Game of Life (LeetCode 289)

We are given an m x n grid representing Conway's Game of Life, where:
- 1 = live cell
- 0 = dead cell

Each cell interacts with its 8 neighbors (horizontally, vertically, diagonally).
The transition rules are:
1. Any live cell with fewer than 2 live neighbors â†’ dies (underpopulation).
2. Any live cell with 2 or 3 live neighbors â†’ lives (survival).
3. Any live cell with more than 3 live neighbors â†’ dies (overpopulation).
4. Any dead cell with exactly 3 live neighbors â†’ becomes a live cell (reproduction).

We must compute the next state of the board **in-place**.

---

ðŸ’¡ Intuition:
If we update directly, neighbor counts will get corrupted (mix of old/new states).
To avoid this, we encode transitions using temporary markers:
-  1 â†’ was alive, becomes dead â†’ mark as -1
-  0 â†’ was dead, becomes alive â†’ mark as 2

This way:
- abs(cell) gives us the original state
- sign / encoded value gives us the new state

At the end, we normalize:
- > 0 â†’ alive (1)
- <= 0 â†’ dead (0)

ðŸ”‘ Pseudo Code:
function gameOfLife(board):
    for each cell (i,j):
        count = live neighbors
        if cell alive:
            if count < 2 or count > 3: mark -1
        else:
            if count == 3: mark 2
    for each cell:
        normalize: >0 â†’ 1, else â†’ 0

---

ðŸ“Š Complexity:
- Time:  O(m * n)  (each cell checks 8 neighbors â†’ O(8*m*n) â‰ˆ O(m*n))
- Space: O(1)      (in-place, only constant extra space)

âœ… Example:
Input:
[[0,1,0],
 [0,0,1],
 [1,1,1],
 [0,0,0]]

Output:
[[0,0,0],
 [1,0,1],
 [0,1,1],
 [0,1,0]]
